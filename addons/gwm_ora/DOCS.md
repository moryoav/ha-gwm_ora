# GWM ORA Add-on Documentation

## Installation

1. Add this repository to the Home Assistant add-on store.
2. Install the **GWM ORA** add-on.
3. Fill in the add-on configuration.
4. Start the add-on.
5. Install the `custom_components/gwm_ora` integration from this repository.
6. Confirm the discovered **GWM ORA** integration in Home Assistant.

## Configuration

| Option | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `country` | yes | Two-letter GWM account region such as `DE` or `GB`. |
| `username` | yes | GWM account e-mail address. |
| `password` | yes | GWM account password. |
| `verification_code` | no | One-time SMS/e-mail verification code sent by GWM during first login or when this add-on device must be trusted. Fill it only after GWM sends a code. |
| `security_pin` | no | Vehicle remote control PIN from the official app. |
| `enable_remote_commands` | yes | Enables A/C, lock, unlock, and close-window commands. |
| `poll_interval_seconds` | yes | GWM cloud polling interval from 30 to 3600 seconds. |
| `log_level` | yes | One of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`, or `error`. |

## First-login verification

When the add-on logs in for the first time, GWM sends a one-time verification code by SMS or e-mail. The add-on log and Web UI will report `verification_required` while it is waiting for that code.

Check the phone messages and e-mail inbox for your GWM account, including spam or junk folders. For European accounts, the e-mail will most likely come from `noreply@gwm-eu.com` with the subject `GWM Verification Code`.

After you receive the code:

1. Open the **GWM ORA** add-on page in Home Assistant.
2. Go to the **Configuration** tab.
3. Click **Show unused optional configuration options**.
4. Fill in **Verification code** (`verification_code`) with the one-time code.
5. Save the configuration.
6. Restart the add-on.

After a successful login, the add-on stores GWM tokens under `/data` and tries to clear `verification_code` from the add-on options. The add-on Web UI should then show **Authenticated** as **Yes** and **Verification** as **Not required**.

If GWM rejects the code, clear `verification_code`, restart the add-on so it requests a fresh code, then enter the new code and restart again. Verification codes are short-lived, so use the newest code you received.

## Web UI

The **Open Web UI** button uses Home Assistant Ingress and shows add-on health plus the latest cached vehicle summary. Remote controls are exposed by the native Home Assistant integration rather than the add-on web page.

## Security

The add-on does not publish a LAN port, does not use host networking, does not request Docker API access, and does not use `full_access`. The internal API requires a generated bearer token, Ingress pages are restricted to Home Assistant's ingress proxy, and the container ships with a custom AppArmor profile.

This repository publishes stable releases only for now; no canary branch is offered.
